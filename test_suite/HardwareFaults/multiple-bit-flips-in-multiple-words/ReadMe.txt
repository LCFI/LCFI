Using this yaml file, you can systematically inject multiple bit-flips in multiple words. The maximum number of bit-flips in one run of the program is controlled by fi_max_multiple. NOTE that a program may crash before being able to inject all bit-flips specified by fi_max_multiple. The distance between each injection is controlled by another two parameter, namely window_len_multiple_startindex and window_len_multiple_endindex.
