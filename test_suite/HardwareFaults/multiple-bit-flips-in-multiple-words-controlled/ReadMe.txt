Using this yaml file, the user could perform multiple bit-flip injections starting from a specific location. The first bit-flip is injected into the 15th bit of a source register of the instruction that has the fi_cycle of 684347 and fi_index of 417. After this bit-flip, another 2 bits could still be flipped since the fi_max_multiple is equal to 3. NOTE that if any of these bit-flips results in a program crash, no more bits will be flipped. The distance between each of these bit-flips are controlled by the window_len_multiple_startindex and window_len_multiple_endindex.
